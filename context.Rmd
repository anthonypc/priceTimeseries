##The Data

Briefly the data being used here was sourced from the ads in Google's search result pages. This was done with a scraper using some PHP and a MySQL database that ran through a list of search terms and archived the html and stored the ads in the database. Archiving the pages as html turned out to be a good idea, as Google did change their mark up a few times over the course of the last year, and some data had to be extracted after the fact.

Some processing was required to create the dataset used here. The display URLs in the ads required some cleaning before they could be used as a proxy for brand and the price information needed to be extracted from the headline and the adcopy. In this exercise, price is generally defined as anything that would match to "$[0-9,]+"
